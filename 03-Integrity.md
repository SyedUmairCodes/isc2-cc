Integrity measures the degree to which something is whole and complete, internally, consistent and correct. The concept of integrity applies to:

- Information or data
- Systems and processes for business operation.
- Organizations
- People and their actions

Data integrity is the assurance that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner. To maintain the integrity of data it is required to secure the systems where the data is stored and modified so that it can't be modified or get in the hands of an malicious actor or get deleted or corrupted.

The information must be consistent across all working systems and only authorized stakeholders should be allowed to modify and access it. All the systems where the data is stored and modified on must also follow the same security principles and rules to preserve the integrity of the data.

The security baseline of all systems should be compared to each other whenever a transaction is made between the devices. If any systems configuration doesn't match the security baseline of the other devices then that device has been compromised and should immediately be removed from the network and be looked at in isolation.

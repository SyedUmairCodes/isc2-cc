The CIA triad is a set of rules for safe keeping data and information, making sure it's private, correct, and available when needed.

The first part is confidentiality, we need to make sure that the asset that we are trying to protect isn't publicly available unless made so. We need to make sure that the asset can only be accessed by the person that is authorized to access it and restrict anyone else that tries to access the asset.

The second part is integrity, and it's all about making sure that the asset that you're protecting hasn't been tampered with and making sure it's the correct asset and not a copy or fake.

The third and last part is availability, The asset that we have been protecting also needs to be accessed by the authorized person when they need it and making sure that they can access the asset and use it.

Availability can be defined as timely and reliable access to information and the ability to use it. The core concept of availability is that data is accessible to authorized users when and where it is needed and in the form and format required.

This does not mean that data or systems are available 100% of the time. Instead, the systems and data meet the requirements of the business for timely and reliable access. 

Some systems and data are far more critical than others, so the cyber security professional must make sure that data is appropriately available when needed.

Passwords and tokens have a simple binary decision to make when the user tries to sign in. Either they are allowed to sign in or not there's no in between.

With bio-metric scanning this is harder because of your fingers can be dirty or wet, there's not enough light in the room, etc.

If you use only your username and password to login then you're using single-factor authentication. If you're using username and password alongside any of the factors listed above then you're using two-factor authentication and if you're using more than two factors then you're using multi-factor authentication to verify your identity.

When you login into a social media website it asks you for your username and password. These are two different things that you're providing but they still count as a single-factor authentication since both the username and password are used together and both of them are in the same factor.

If the site asks you for a security passphrase or a one-time pin code that you'll receive via email or an authenticator app then it would be two or multi factor authentication.

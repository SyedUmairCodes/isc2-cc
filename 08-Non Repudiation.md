Non-repudiation is a term that is used in legal environments and is the protection against an individual or entity from denying performing a transaction.

If a person has signed a contract with a business or a bank then they can't deny signing it. In our modern world e-commerce has allowed people to buy whatever they want on the internet and use their credit cards to pay for it.

If the credit card gets stolen then the victim should immediately call the bank and de-activate the card. If the person that stole the card uses it for a transaction then the owner of the card will be held responsible for all of the transactions.

Non-repudiation also applies to physical transactions such as property and car dealings as well as non-monetary transactions like sending an email or sending a parcel via mail.

The process of using just the username and password for identification and authorization has been around since 1960. But, in modern times, these two credentials can easily be compromised so three new security factors were introduced in order to make the identity of users more secure.

The three factors include:
- A pin code or a passphrase - something that you know.
- A physical key or authentication device - something that you have.
- Bio-metric scans of the fingerprint, face, or the retina - something that you are.

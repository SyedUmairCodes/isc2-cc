For security purposes we can't allocate any credentials to an unknown user. If the user wants to get the credentials that they need to first need to verify their identity using different methods so that we can be assured that the person asking for the credentials is someone that we trust or can trust and not someone pretending to be them.

> There are going to be different levels that will be different across the board when you are going to attempt to verify your identity. 

If you want to get a passport you have to go to the passport office in person to verify yourself and your documents. When you create a new account on a social media platform, you'll need to enter your name, DoB, email, and phone number so that you can be verified.

Once verified, you are given your own username and password and you will use those two credentials whenever you want log in to your account.

Confidentiality can become extremely hard to achieve since a user can access the resources from any modern computer and mobile device and it can't always be made sure that device the user is using is secure and not compromised.

So we must regulate that the authorized users may only use authorized devices (that need to be inspected on a weekly or daily basis) to access the resources to make sure of the confidentiality of the resources.

The most important data that needs to be kept confidential is personal identifiable information (PII). It can contain information about a person's health condition, a company's trade secrets, private research, and other data which can be used to identify a person or company and its future plans.

Safe guarding PII is a core responsibility of the cyber security team. The sensitivity of the data is also a big factor when deciding to secure it. If sensitive information is publicly leaked or a malicious actor modifies it then it can cause harm to organization or individual.

In many cases, sensitivity is related to the harm to external stakeholders, people or organizations that may not be a part of the organization that processes or uses the information.
